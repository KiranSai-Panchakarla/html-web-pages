    <p>
        It was a <b>hot summer day</b>. A crow was feeling very <i>thirsty</i>.
        <div class=""></div>
        He flew here and there in search of <u>water</u>, but could not find any.
    </p>
    The sun was blazing.<br> The crow became tired and sat under a tree.<br>
    <p> 
        Suddenly, he saw a <b><u>pot</u></b> in a garden.
        He flew to it and saw that the water was very <i>low</i>.
    </p>

        He got an idea. He picked up some pebbles and dropped them one by one into the pot.
    </font>
    <p>
        But before that, he paused and thought:
    </p>
    <pre>
        "This water is too low.
         How can I drink it?
         If I drop pebbles,
         the water might rise...
         Yes! That's what I'll do!"
    </pre>
    <p>As he did this, the water level slowly rose up. Soon, he
        was able to drink the water.
    </p>
    <font face="courier" size="5" color="green">
        He drank the water happily and flew away.
    </font>
    <p>
        On his way, he told other birds about this trick.<br>
        They praised his cleverness and presence of mind.<br>
        The crow became famous in the forest for his smart thinking.
